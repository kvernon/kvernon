### Hi there 👋

#### About

My Personal github is to explore and capture overall ideas. 

For me, I'm an experienced leader with experience all over the stack, but I tend to focus on API and cloud (aws) more. In here, I'm currently heads down examining bringing a realty library to life through react and a medical SaaS application to existence.
